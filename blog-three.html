            <h2>What is a Framework?</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>framework</strong> in web development is a pre-written collection of tools, libraries, and best practices that developers use 
                to create websites and web applications. It provides a structured foundation, streamlining development by offering pre-built components 
                like templates, APIs, and standard coding patterns. Frameworks help developers avoid reinventing the wheel, allowing them to focus on 
                building unique features rather than handling repetitive tasks.
            </p>

            <p>There are different types of web development frameworks, including front-end, back-end, and full-stack frameworks.</p>

            <h3>Front-end Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Front-end frameworks</strong> like React, Angular, and Vue.js focus on building the user interface and enhancing the user experience.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Back-end Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Back-end frameworks</strong> such as Django, Laravel, and Express.js handle server-side operations, database interactions, and 
                application logic.
            </p>

            <h3>Full-stack Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Full-stack frameworks</strong> like Meteor and Next.js cover both front-end and back-end aspects, allowing developers to manage 
                an entire application within a unified environment.

            <h3>Why Use a Framework?</h3>
            <p>
                By using a framework, developers benefit from enhanced efficiency, consistency, and scalability. Frameworks often come with robust documentation 
                and a strong community, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and implement best practices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Choosing the right framework depends on the specific requirements of a project, such as scalability, performance, and team familiarity. 
                Ultimately, frameworks act as the backbone of modern web development, helping teams deliver reliable and sophisticated web solutions faster.
