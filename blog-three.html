            <h1>What is a Framework in Web Development?</h1>

        <h2>Framework</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>framework </strong>in web development is a pre-written collection of tools, libraries, and best practices that developers use to 
            create websites and web applications. It provides a structured foundation to streamline development by offering pre-built components 
            like templates, APIs, and standard coding patterns. Frameworks help developers avoid reinventing the wheel, enabling them to focus on
             building unique features rather than solving repetitive or foundational tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are different types of web development frameworks, including front-end, back-end, and full-stack frameworks. 
        </p>

        <h3>Front-end</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Front-end frameworks</strong> like React, Angular, and Vue.js focus on building the user interface and enhancing the user experience.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Back-end</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Back-end frameworks</strong> such as Django, Laravel, and Express.js deal with server-side operations, database interactions, and application logic.
        </p>

        <h3>Full-stack</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Full-stack frameworks</strong> like Meteor and Next.js cover both front-end and back-end aspects, allowing developers to manage an entire application within a unified environment.
        </p>

            <h1>Uses</h1>
            <p>
                By using a framework, developers benefit from enhanced efficiency, consistency, and scalability. Frameworks often come with robust documentation and a strong community, making it easier 
                to troubleshoot issues and implement best practices. However, choosing the right framework depends on the specific requirements of the project, such as scalability, performance, and team familiarity. Ultimately, frameworks act as the backbone of modern web development, helping teams deliver reliable and sophisticated web solutions faster.
